xgcm: General Circulation Model Postprocessing with xarray
==========================================================

**xgcm** aims to become a general purpose tool for processing GCM output in
python. xgcm is built on top of xarray_, which provides most of the core data
model, indexing, and (via dask_) parallel, out-of-core array computation. On
top of this, xgcm adds an understanding of the finite volume `Arakawa Grids`_
commonly used in ocean and atmospheric models, differential and integral
operators suited to these grids, and a toolbox of common analysis functions.

**xgcm** was motivated by the rapid growth in the numerical resolution of
ocean, atmosphere, and climate models. While highly parallel supercomputers can
now easily generate tera- and petascale datasets, common post-processing
workflows struggle with these volumes. Furthermore, we believe that a flexible,
evolving, open-source, python-based framework for GCM analysis will enhance
the productivity of the field as a whole, accelerating the rate of discovery in
climate science.
